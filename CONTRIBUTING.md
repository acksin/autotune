# Contributing

First of all thank you for wanting to contribute. We have massive
goals for this project and we want everyone to contribute whether it
is doing frontend in JavaScript, Machine Learning Algorithms with
Tensorflow, Kernel and Cloud digging with Python or even contributing
Github Issues we'd love to have you help out.

## Non-Code Contributions

How you debug a system is unique. What do you look at? What do you do
that helps you figure out what a system should look like? Help us out.
Give us some of those ideas. We'd love to see how we can take those
ideas and turn them into code.

## Bugs

Please create a Github Issue for any bug that you find. Even if you
don't think it is a bug still report it. Anything that makes your
servers perform poorly is considered a bug!

## Code

Our goal is to get you to contribute code as fast as possible. So our
philosophy is evolutionary changes. Create a Pull Request ASAP even
for the simplest or the most complicated things. We will then work on
it together with constant feedback. We want to reduce the amount of
waste that goes into creating your patch and give you as possible.

Somethings to keep in mind though while making changes:

 - Update DOCS.org with your new change.
 - If you are adding a significant enough feature add it in the
   RELEASE.org.
